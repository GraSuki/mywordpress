					<description><![CDATA[Crafted with coconut oil to help lock in moisture, so skin never feels dry or stripped. Unlike other soaps, our unique blend of coconut oil + clay is soothing to dry, red, irritated skin without any compromise on the scent. It’s ok if you do a happy dance. We do too because we have soft, smooth, hydrated skin and smell elegant.

INGREDIENTS:

Coconut Oil, Palm Oil, Safflower Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerine, Purified Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Sorbitol, Sorbitan Oleate, Soy Bean Protein.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep your shampoo, body wash, and other bottles high and dry. We love these because they prevent those grungy rings that get left, leaving you scrubbing off your shower shelves! Let your razor, toothbrush, and jewelry dry without leaving residue behind. It is made of multi-directional bioplastic that allows water to drain and air to circulate. Cleans remarkably well by simply rinsing under running water and giving it a few squeezes.</p>
<p>Don’t let your soap turn into muck! Soap Lift is made of a multi-directional bioplastic that allows water to drain and air to circulate. They can be used in soap dishes, on shower shelves, or on countertops. Cleans remarkably well by simply holding it under running water and giving it a few squeezes.</p>
